      "whatIsPasswordGenerator": "What is a password generator?",
      "whatIsPasswordGeneratorContent": "A password generator is a specialized online tool for creating cryptographically strong passwords with customizable security parameters. Unlike simple generators, it considers modern cybersecurity requirements and allows creating passwords in different languages with flexible complexity settings. The tool uses a cryptographically strong random number generation algorithm, ensuring unpredictability and uniqueness of each password. This makes brute-force attacks practically impossible.",
      "whyNeeded": "Why do you need a password generator",
      "whyNeededSubtitle": "Main tasks and advantages",
      "whyNeededContent": "Weak passwords are the main cause of account breaches and data leaks. People often use simple combinations, birth dates, or reuse passwords across different services, creating critical vulnerabilities. A password generator solves this problem by creating unique, complex passwords for each account. The tool is especially important for business: IT administrators generate temporary passwords for employees, developers create API keys, and security specialists form passwords for test accounts. Regular generation of new passwords is the foundation of modern information security.",
      "howItWorks": "How the generator works",
      "howItWorksSubtitle": "Principles and technologies",
      "howItWorksContent": "The generator uses a cryptographically strong entropy source to create truly random sequences. The system forms a character set based on selected parameters: language alphabet, numbers, special symbols, letter case. Then the algorithm guarantees to include at least one character from each selected category and fills the remaining length with random characters. Final shuffling ensures even distribution of characters throughout the password length. This approach eliminates predictable patterns and ensures maximum entropy.",
      "whatPasswords": "What passwords can be created",
      "whatPasswordsContent": "The tool supports creating passwords of any complexity: from simple letter combinations to complex multi-character sequences with numbers and special characters. Three languages are available - Russian, English, and Ukrainian, allowing creation of passwords with national characters. You can set length from 1 to 100 characters, include or exclude uppercase letters, numbers, special symbols. The system generates from 1 to 10 passwords simultaneously, which is convenient for mass account creation or updating passwords for multiple accounts.",
      "forSpecialists": "Who benefits from the tool",
      "forSpecialistsContent": "The generator is critically important for IT administrators who manage corporate systems and create employee accounts. Information security specialists use it to generate temporary passwords during audits and testing. Developers create API keys, access tokens, and passwords for test databases. System administrators generate passwords for servers, databases, and network equipment. Regular users enhance security of personal accounts. Companies use the tool to comply with security policies and regulatory requirements.",
      "howToUse": "How to use the generator",
      "howToUseContent": "Usage is extremely simple: select password length using the slider or enter exact value, specify alphabet language, check needed character types (uppercase letters, numbers, special characters), set number of passwords to generate, and click 'Generate' button. Ready passwords will appear in the result field and be ready for copying. For maximum security, it's recommended to use passwords of 12+ characters with all character types included. Each password is unique and meets modern security standards."

The generator also helps copywriters and content managers increase productivity when working with large volumes of material.",
      "howItWorks": "How the AI generator works",
      "howItWorksSubtitle": "Principles and technologies",
      "howItWorksContent": "The tool is based on transformer neural networks trained on billions of text documents. The system analyzes language patterns, sentence structure, and semantic connections between words. During generation, AI considers specified parameters: language, text volume, number of paragraphs, and topic. The algorithm sequentially creates sentences while maintaining logical coherence and natural presentation. This allows obtaining texts that read naturally and correspond to human writing style.",
      "whatTexts": "What texts can be created",
      "whatTextsContent": "The tool supports text generation in Russian, English, and Ukrainian languages. You can create articles, product descriptions, social media posts, website content, test content for layouts. Length customization is available from a few sentences to large articles of thousands of characters. The system automatically structures text into paragraphs for better readability. Classic Lorem Ipsum is also available for design tasks where text structure matters more than meaning.",

Users set minimum and maximum values, and the required number count. When 'No repeats' mode is activated, the system tracks already generated numbers and excludes them from subsequent results. This guarantees uniqueness of each number in generation series, critically important for lotteries and participant selection. The algorithm ensures equal probability of each number appearing in the specified range.",

You can create both single numbers and series of up to 10 numbers simultaneously. Positive numbers, zero, and even negative values are available with appropriate range settings.

The system automatically tracks generation timestamps for result documentation.",

      "forSpecialistsContent": "The generator is critically important for event organizers conducting fair draws and lotteries. Teachers use it for random student selection, creating task variants, and forming groups. Software developers generate test data, random IDs, and tokens. Researchers and analysts create random samples for statistical studies. QA engineers test applications with various data sets. Gamers add randomness elements to board games and RPGs. Marketers conduct A/B testing with random user distribution.",

      "howToUseContent": "Usage is extremely simple: set minimum value using 'FROM' slider or enter exact number, set maximum value with 'TO' slider, choose number of generated numbers (1 to 10). If unique numbers are needed, activate 'No repeats' checkbox. Click 'Show Result' button and get random number list. Use 'Copy' button for quick result copying. 'Reset' button clears unique number history and allows starting generation anew."

      "whatIsAnalyticsText": "End-to-end analytics is a comprehensive approach to business efficiency analysis that tracks the entire customer journey from the first ad click to purchase completion and profit generation. Unlike fragmented analysis of individual metrics, end-to-end analytics combines data from all sources: advertising systems, website, CRM, call center, and financial reporting to get a complete picture of marketing effectiveness.",
      "whyNeededAnalytics": "Why end-to-end analytics is needed",
      "whyNeededAnalyticsTitle": "Main tasks and advantages",
      "whyNeededAnalyticsText": "Traditional analytics shows only individual metrics but doesn't provide understanding of real profitability. End-to-end analytics allows precise determination of which advertising channels and campaigns bring profit and which bring losses. This is critically important for proper budget allocation, scaling profitable directions, and shutting down unprofitable ones. The tool helps make data-driven decisions rather than assumptions.",
      "howItWorks": "How the analytics system works",
      "howItWorksTitle": "Principles and technologies",
      "howItWorksText": "The system collects data from all stages of the sales funnel: impressions and clicks from advertising cabinets, website conversions, lead and sales data from CRM, financial indicators for profit and margin. All metrics are connected by mathematical formulas, ensuring automatic recalculation when any parameter changes. This allows modeling various scenarios and forecasting results.",
      "whatMetrics": "What metrics are tracked",
      "whatMetricsText": "The tool analyzes over 20 key indicators divided into 6 groups: traffic (clicks, impressions, CTR), costs (CPC, advertising spend), website (conversion, leads, CPL), sales (conversion to sale, deal count, CPO), pricing (average order value, revenue, margin) and profitability (net profit, ROMI, ROAS). Additionally, special formulas are calculated: DRR, ICCR, CPM for deep efficiency analysis.",
      "whoNeedsIt": "Who needs end-to-end analytics",
      "whoNeedsItText": "Business leaders use it for strategic decisions about scaling and investments. Marketers — for optimizing advertising campaigns and acquisition channels. Advertising specialists — for bid and budget optimization. Analysts — for reporting and forecasting. E-commerce owners — for understanding real profitability of products and traffic sources. Agencies — for demonstrating real effectiveness of their work to clients.",
      "howToUse": "How to use the analytics tool",
      "howToUseText": "Start by filling in basic metrics: click and impression counts from advertising cabinet, CPC and advertising spend. Specify website conversions and lead count, conversion to sale and average order value. Add product or service margin data. The system automatically calculates all derived indicators: CPL, CPO, profit, ROMI, ROAS. Use AI analysis for optimization recommendations and export data to Excel for further work."

      "whatIsSynonymGeneratorContent": "An AI synonym generator is a modern online tool based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies. Unlike simple synonym dictionaries, it doesn't just pick random alternatives, but considers the context in which a word or expression is used. Thanks to this, you get not only a list of possible replacements, but truly appropriate, accurate and stylistically suitable synonyms. This approach allows you to improve text readability, make it more lively, natural and convincing.",

      "whyNeededSubtitle": "Main tasks and advantages",
      "whyNeededContent": "Frequent repetition of the same words makes text monotonous and reduces its effectiveness — whether it's a blog article, product description or advertisement. The AI synonym generator helps solve this problem: it diversifies vocabulary, improves style and makes content more professional. The tool is especially useful for SEO, as search engines value texts with rich vocabulary where key queries are organically woven into the structure. The generator also helps copywriters create multiple versions of the same text, which is convenient for testing advertisements or social media posts.",

      "howItWorksSubtitle": "Principles and technologies",
      "howItWorksContent": "The tool is based on machine learning algorithms and neural networks trained on huge text corpora. The system analyzes the meaning of a word, its grammatical form and surrounding context. For example, the word 'key' can mean a tool, water source or solution to a problem. The generator determines which exact variant is needed and selects correct synonyms. This makes results more accurate and eliminates 'random' replacements characteristic of traditional dictionaries. As a result, you get a list of words that can be used in text without risk of distorting meaning.",
      "whatTexts": "What words are supported",
      "whatTextsContent": "The AI synonym generator works with virtually all parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, set phrases and even idioms. It is equally useful in everyday vocabulary and professional spheres — whether marketing, law, medicine or IT. For example, a marketer can find different variants for an advertising slogan, and a student can improve formulations in academic work. Support for different speech styles — from business to artistic — makes the tool a universal assistant for any tasks.",
      "forSpecialists": "Who benefits from the tool",
      "forSpecialistsContent": "The online generator will be an indispensable assistant for copywriters and SEO specialists who work with texts daily. Journalists and bloggers can use it to improve style and avoid repetitions. Translators — to find more precise words depending on context. Students and teachers — to diversify language in academic works and lectures. Marketers and advertisers can prepare multiple versions of ads and slogans for A/B testing. Writers and screenwriters will find a source of fresh ideas for artistic texts in the tool. Essentially, anyone who wants to write richer and more convincingly will find it useful.",
      "howToUse": "How to use the generator",
      "howToUseContent": "Working with the tool is very simple: paste words or phrases into the input field (one per line), select the generation language and click the 'Show result' button. Within seconds, the system will suggest a list of synonyms selected considering meaning and style. You can quickly copy ready variants and use them in text — whether it's an article, social media post, advertisement or letter. Thanks to the simple interface, you can use the generator even without special knowledge — everything is intuitive and convenient."

      "howToUseContent": "Usage is extremely simple: paste the first word list in the left field (each word on a new line), the second list in the right field. Choose an appropriate connector from the suggested options or enter your own in the 'Other' field. Click 'Show Result' and get a ready list of glued elements.
