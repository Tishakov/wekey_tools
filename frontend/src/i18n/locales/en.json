      "whatIsSynonymGenerator": "What is an AI synonym generator?",
      "whatIsSynonymGeneratorContent": "An AI synonym generator is a modern online tool based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies. Unlike simple synonym dictionaries, it doesn't just pick random alternatives, but considers the context in which a word or expression is used. Thanks to this, you get not only a list of possible replacements, but truly appropriate, accurate and stylistically suitable synonyms. This approach allows you to improve text readability, make it more lively, natural and convincing.",
      "whyNeeded": "Why do you need a synonym generator",
      "whyNeededSubtitle": "Main tasks and advantages",
      "whyNeededContent": "Frequent repetition of the same words makes text monotonous and reduces its effectiveness — whether it's a blog article, product description or advertisement. The AI synonym generator helps solve this problem: it diversifies vocabulary, improves style and makes content more professional. The tool is especially useful for SEO, as search engines value texts with rich vocabulary where key queries are organically woven into the structure. The generator also helps copywriters create multiple versions of the same text, which is convenient for testing advertisements or social media posts.",
      "howItWorks": "How the AI generator works",
      "howItWorksSubtitle": "Principles and technologies",
      "howItWorksContent": "The tool is based on machine learning algorithms and neural networks trained on huge text corpora. The system analyzes the meaning of a word, its grammatical form and surrounding context. For example, the word 'key' can mean a tool, water source or solution to a problem. The generator determines which exact variant is needed and selects correct synonyms. This makes results more accurate and eliminates 'random' replacements characteristic of traditional dictionaries. As a result, you get a list of words that can be used in text without risk of distorting meaning.",
      "whatTexts": "What words are supported",
      "whatTextsContent": "The AI synonym generator works with virtually all parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, set phrases and even idioms. It is equally useful in everyday vocabulary and professional spheres — whether marketing, law, medicine or IT. For example, a marketer can find different variants for an advertising slogan, and a student can improve formulations in academic work. Support for different speech styles — from business to artistic — makes the tool a universal assistant for any tasks.",
      "forSpecialists": "Who benefits from the tool",
      "forSpecialistsContent": "The online generator will be an indispensable assistant for copywriters and SEO specialists who work with texts daily. Journalists and bloggers can use it to improve style and avoid repetitions. Translators — to find more precise words depending on context. Students and teachers — to diversify language in academic works and lectures. Marketers and advertisers can prepare multiple versions of ads and slogans for A/B testing. Writers and screenwriters will find a source of fresh ideas for artistic texts in the tool. Essentially, anyone who wants to write richer and more convincingly will find it useful.",
      "howToUse": "How to use the generator",
      "howToUseContent": "Working with the tool is very simple: paste words or phrases into the input field (one per line), select the generation language and click the 'Show result' button. Within seconds, the system will suggest a list of synonyms selected considering meaning and style. You can quickly copy ready variants and use them in text — whether it's an article, social media post, advertisement or letter. Thanks to the simple interface, you can use the generator even without special knowledge — everything is intuitive and convenient."
